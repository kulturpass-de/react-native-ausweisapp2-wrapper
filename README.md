## About this project

This library wraps and asyncifies the [AusweisApp SDK by Governikus](https://github.com/Governikus/AusweisApp2) and enables react-native apps to support eID verification of German documents with NFC. The communication with the SDK is done by sending ['Commands'](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/sdk/commands.html) and reacting to ['Messages'](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/sdk/messages.html). To orchestrate and simplify the API with the SDK through async functions, RxJS is used as a core driver of this library.

## Requirements

To use this library, at least the following requirements have to be fulfilled:

- iOS 16.0
- Android 9 and SDK version 28

## Getting Started

To add the library to your project, do the following:

1. Add react-native-ausweisapp2-wrapper to your project
```
$ yarn add react-native-ausweisapp2-wrapper
```
2. Prepare Cocoapod dependency
```
$ pod install
```

### Android

1. Add the following to your android/app/build.gradle:
```groovy
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    packagingOptions {
        // Fixes build error: 2 files found with path 'lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst "lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so"
        // Needed for aab (Android App Bundle) creation.
        // The AusweisApp SDK will not work correctly without it
        // See also https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/sdk/android.html#app-bundle
        jniLibs { useLegacyPackaging = true }
    }
```
See also https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/sdk/android.html#app-bundle

The current AA2 SDK supports only 64-bit devices. The AA2 SDK does not work with 32-bit devices like the Samsung A13. Using the SDK on these devices leads to the error `com.governikus.ausweisapp2.AidlBinder.resetValidSessionID`

2. Add those lines to your android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<manifest ... >
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC"/>
  <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.nfc" android:required="false" />
...
```
See also https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc#manifest

### iOS
1. Add the following lines to your ios/cultureapp/Info.plist:
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.iso7816.select-identifiers</key>
<array>
  <string>E80704007F00070302</string>
</array>

<key>NFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
<string>AusweisApp needs NFC to access the ID card.</string>
```
See also https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/sdk/ios.html#info-plist

2. Add an entitlement file to your app, with the following content or enable the Near Field Communication Tag Reading capability in Xcode.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.formats</key>
    <array>
      <string>TAG</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

## Usage

There are two main components used for interacting with the SDK. The _CommandService_, is used for basic functionality, such as starting and stopping the SDK and sending Commands to it. The _WorkflowHelper_, handles abstractions for the general identification workflow and adds other functionality that is not provided by the SDK (i.e. checking if NFC is enabled on Android).

### Start SDK

To start the SDK, `CommandService.start` has to be called. To initialize the SDK and setup logging in one step, the `WorkflowHelper.initializeAA2Sdk` function is used.

Example:

```typescript
WorkflowHelper.initializeAA2Sdk(true, 2)
```

### Stop SDK
Stopping the SDK and NFC capability is done by calling the `CommandService.stop` method. This is also done when the application is reloaded by metro.

### Send a Command to the SDK

With the `CommandService` Commands can be sent to the SDK. Commands that expect a Message as a response, are async functions that can be awaited.

Example:

```typescript
async () {
  const info = await CommandService.getInfo()
  return info
}
```
In this case, we return the Info Message that will be sent as a reply by the AusweisApp SDK.

Some Commands need additional data to be sent to the SDK. The data is always provided using parameters.

```typescript
async () {
  const reader = await CommandService.getReader("NFC")
  return reader
}
```

Optionally each command supports providing an options object as the last parameter that is used to configure the command. Currently only a milliseconds timeout is supported via `msTimeout`. This timeout is used for the maximum time that an async function waits for its Message response. If no Message response is provided in that time, a `TimeoutError` is thrown.

For examples on how to a basic identification flow works, have a look at https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/sdk/workflow.html

Example of the wrapper usage you can find here:
https://github.com/kulturpass-de/kulturpass-app/blob/main/src/features/eid-verification/services/eid-ausweisapp2-service.ts

### Deactivated Cards

Deactivated cards are handled the same as error Messages. Commands such as `accept` on the `CommandService` will throw a `Reader` Message if a deactivated card is detected. To handle `Reader` Messages with deactivated cards asynchonously, use the `handleError` callback on the `WorkflowService` or filter Messages on the `AA2MessageObservable` itself.
